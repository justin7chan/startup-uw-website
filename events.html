                        </header>
                        <p>In a time where technology and social media have integrated to become a significant part of our lives,
                            a question that consistently rises is about the prevalence of privacy, how do we regulate and sustain
                            our privacy in an age of rapidly developing technology, and more importantly, how do we convince
                            giant tech corporations of the importance of privacy in our internet use?
                        </p>
                        <p>Our speaker for the event is Mr. Timothy B. McCormack, attorney-at-law specializing in Technology, Copyright
                            and IP law and also, MGMT 200 Adjunct Professor at the Foster School of Business. Mr. McCormack has
                            been a successful attorney for more than 17 years, and is also the owner of Antoine Creek Farms.
                            He has written an online book on IP Law, and is also a writer for the Copyright Cow Column at Seattle
